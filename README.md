# MLNBoostDBMarcin

The Development version of Marcin's code on database integration of MLN-Boost.
Current I am writing a wrapper on top of it to make it interface the same way as MLN-Boost.

Usage:

java -jar [jar file] [-l -train [train folder path]] [-i -test [test folder path]] [-model [models folder path]] - target [target predicate name] -trees [# trees]
